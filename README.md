# Tableau-and-R - Creating a Data Dictionary
Different Tableau and R automation projects

Data Dictionary.R creates a data dictionary using all fields from Tableau.  This is useful for checking calculations, data type, naming and formatting for each field in Tableau. The code inputs a Tableau.twb (which is converted to an XML file), and outputs a CSV with one row per field. Instructions for creating an xml file from a twb is included in the code. 

This is inspired by the following work which provides a similar output but uses Python:
